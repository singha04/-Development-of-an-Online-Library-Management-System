# -Development-of-an-Online-Library-Management-System
Building a comprehensive online library management system utilizing the MERN stack
(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Core Components: Backend Development: Utilize Node.js as the primary runtime environment. Implement server-side logic using Express.js. Integrate MongoDB as the database for data persistence. Frontend Development: Develop the user interface with React.js, ensuring a responsive and intuitive design. System Entities and Properties: Books: Name Author Current Availability Status

User: Username Name Email Contact Number

Admin User: Username Name Password (Ensure secure handling) Email Contact Number

Library Transaction: User details Book details Due date Transaction type (borrowed/returned) Functional Requirements: Admin User Operations: Issue and return books, altering their availability status. Add new books to the system. Remove existing books from the inventory.

User Interactions (Read-Only): Browse the library catalog. View personal transaction history. Assumptions: For simplicity, assume normal users have no system privileges beyond viewing. 
All administrative operations (issuing, returning, adding, or removing books) are exclusively performed by the admin user. Deliverables: API Endpoints: Creation and management of books, users, and transactions. Detailed API documentation.

Frontend Interface: Separate interfaces for Admin and User roles. Efficient navigation and user-friendly design.

Security Measures: (Optional) Implementation of JWT for authentication. Role-based access control.

Testing: (Optional) Comprehensive unit and integration tests. Documentation of testing procedures and results.

Deployment Strategy: (Optional) Outline a plan for deploying the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS). Additional Considerations: Provide clear and thorough documentation covering all aspects of the system. The application should be scalable and maintainable.
